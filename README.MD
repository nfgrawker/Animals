#Animals
Welcome to Animals, this project demonstrates the ability to code ETL in python utilizing REST Apis. 

I chose to use a Hypermodern Python stack loosely based on https://medium.com/@cjolowicz/hypermodern-python-d44485d9d769.

- Desert/Marshmallow for typing/schema validation.
- Click for styling, could also be used for command line args if needed.
- Black for formatting
- Flake8 for style guide.


#Setup
1. Have python(3.6 or later preferred.) installed. If you are familiar with virtual envs, then you can create and run one. 
2. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the base Animals Directory.
3. run `python main.py` from the base Animals Directory.
